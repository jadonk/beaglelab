High level design plan

  * Design hardware interfaces to capture data in standard format using standard protocols
  * GPIO Drivers on which other virtual drivers can be implemented (like RS232, SPI, I2C etc...)
  * Every hardware interface should be accessible using a uniform technique
  * GNOME Widgets for visualizing the data captured and plotting graphs
  * Widgets will have controls to save the captured data on file system or remote server.
  * Tiny HTTP server publishes web pages for remote monitoring
